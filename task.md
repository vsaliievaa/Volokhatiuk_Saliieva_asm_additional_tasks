```
18. Given a pointer to a linked list, reverse it inplace. <br>
function prototype

```
where `struct linked_list_node` is defined as
```c
struct linked_list_node
{
    struct linked_list_node* next;
    int32_t data;
};
```
19. Given a pointer to a linked list, reverse it inplace. <br>
function prototype 
```c
struct linked_list_node* func (struct linked_list_node* node);
```
where `struct linked_list_node` is defined as
```c
struct linked_list_node
{
    int64_t data;
    struct linked_list_node* next;
};
```
remarks: <br>
Note that the structure differs from the one given in 18th task.

20. Given an unsigned 2-byte value, convert it to a sequence of 4 ASCII characters, representing the value in hexadecimal.<br>
function prototype 
```c
void func (uint16_t number, char* chars);
```
remarks: <br>
A few examples of values and corresponding ascii: \
10 -> 000A\
17 -> 0011\
255 -> 00FF\
266 -> 010A\
57005 -> DEAD\
Don't set the `'\0'` at the end of `chars` in this function.
Don't forget about endianess of your system!

21. Given an expression in polish notation, evaluate it and return the result. <br>
function prototype
```c
int64_t func (char* expression);
```
remarks: <br>
For simplicity, we assume the following conditions are always met:
- `expression` can be evaluated
- `expression` is a valid non-null and non-empty C-string consisting of ASCII characters
- `expression` can only contain operators `+`,`-` and numbers `0-9`, encoded as ASCII characters
- 64-bit integer overflows cannot occur

In order to determine the size of the string, consider implementing a separate `strlen` procedure.

Examples of expressions and corresponding evaluation results:\
`"+11"` -> 2 \
`"-1+2-33"` -> -1 \
`"-+8-642"` -> 8

## Work in progress tasks
> Note to contributors: this is a pool of other tasks the are or were considered, but either were discarded due to difficulty, or are still being worked on. It's possible to switch out some of the tasks from previous sections with these. In such case, the replaced task goes into the [Previous tasks (replaced)](#previous-tasks-replaced) section. Also, the total number of tasks must be divisible by 3, therefore new tasks must be added in triplets. 

22. Given a C-string, count the number of characters, words and lines in it. \
function prototype
```c
void func (char *string, uint64_t *chars, uint64_t *words, uint64_t *lines)
```
Remarks:
For simplicity, we assume the following conditions are always met:
- All pointers are non-null. The function should set `chars`, `words` and `lines` accordingly before it returns.
- `string` is always a valid C-string. However, it can be an empty string `""`.
- The only space character this function should detect is `' '`, which is `0x20` in hex. All other sybols, except `'\n'` and `\0` can be assumed to be letters.

In all other cases behaviour of this function should be similar to the standard UNIX command line tool `wc`. Use it to verify the correctness of your function.

A few common pitfalls:
- all characters, even `' '` and `'\n'` should be counted. For example, string `" \n \n"` should result in `chars = 4; words = 0; lines = 2`.
- `lines` represents the number of `'\n'` characters in your string. This means that for a string `"Hello, world!"`, the result should be `lines = 0`, while for `"Hello, world!\n"` it should be `lines = 1`.
- The number of words does not correspond to the number of spaces. For example, `" \n hello\n"`, which contains two spaces, results in `words = 1; chars = 9; lines = 2`.

23. Given arrays with coefficients for line equations and coordinates of a point P in 2D Euclidian space, find the distance to each line. \
function prototype
```c
void func (int32_t p_x, int32_t p_y, int32_t *a, int32_t *b, int32_t *c, float *distances, uint64_t size)
```
Tips:
- In order to compute the reciprocal of square root <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}">, use the `rsqrtss` instruction. The result is approximate, but that is acceptable in this task. Do not forget to load your desired operand to a 32-bit float beforehand.

24. Given arrays with coefficients for line equations and coordinates of a point P in 2D Euclidian space, return the index of a line, to which P is the closest. \
function prototype
```c
uint64_t func (int32_t p_x, int32_t p_y, int32_t *a, int32_t *b, int32_t *c, uint64_t size)
```
Tips:
- In order to compute the reciprocal of square root <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}">, use the `rsqrtss` instruction. The result is approximate, but that is acceptable in this task. Do not forget to load your desired operand to a 32-bit float beforehand.
- To compare two 32-bit float values in `xmm` registers, use the `comiss` instuction combined with `ja/jb` conditional jump instructions. For more info, see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30563286) stackoverflow answer. 

25. Given two arrays of points A and B, pairs of which define lines <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\overline{AB_i}%3D(A_i%2C%20B_i)">, and coordinates of a point P in 2D Euclidian space, return the index of the line to which P belongs. If P is not on any of the lines, return -1 \
function prototype
```c
int64_t func (int64_t *a_x, int64_t *a_y, int64_t *b_x, int64_t *b_y, uint64_t size, int64_t p_x, int64_t p_y)
```

26. Given two arrays a and b of 32-bit signed fixed point values with radix point positions given in r_a and r_b, compute their sum and store the result in an array of 64-bit signed **Q**<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\min(r_a,%20r_b)"> fixed point values. \
function prototype
```c
void func (int32_t* a, int32_t* b, uint8_t r_a, uint8_t r_b, int64_t* results, uint64_t size)
```
Hints:
- **Q**f notation means a fixed point value with ``f`` least significant bits used for the fractional part and the rest for the integer part. The radix point is the bit position of the "dot" which divides the integer and the fractional part. \
For example, 32-bit signed **Q**16 Fixed-point values, in general, are just integers where 16 least significant bytes are used for the fractional part, the most significant bit is the sign bit, and 15 bits between the sign bit and the start of the fractional part are used for the integer part
- When moving from 32-bit to 64-bit registers, don't forget to sign-extend

27. Given two arrays a and b of 32-bit signed **Q**20 fixed-point values, compute their products and store the results in an array of same type \
function prototype
```c
void func (int32_t* a, int32_t* b, int32_t* results, uint64_t size)
```
remarks: \
For simplicity, we assume that overflows that occur when the 12-bit integer part is too big (e.g. `2048.0 * 4.0`) can be ignored. However, this does not mean that overflows cannot occur in the entire 32-bit fixed-point value! Take a look at the documentation of `mul`, `sar` and `shrd` instructions in order to better understand implications of this and how to handle them. 

Hint: \
Consider initially decreasing the accuracy of fixed-point values by shifting both by `10` and then proceeding with the multiplication.   

28. Given an array of 32-bit float point values, convert them into 32-bit **Q**16 fixed point values without using float multiplication. \
function prototype
```c
void func (float* floats, int32_t* fixed, uint64_t size)
```
remarks: \
For detailed discussion about how such function should behave, see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65974190) stackoverflow answer. However, note that assembly implementation will somewhat differ, as some instructions simplify this problem.

29. Given an array of 16-bit uint that each represent [15,11] Hamming codes with parity check (SECDED), correct single-bit errors by changing the appropriate bit and detect two-bit errors by setting a boolean flag in another array.\
function prototype
```c
void func (uint16_t* codes, uint8_t* two_errors, uint64_t size)
```
Hint: Error correction and detection can be achieved only by using a few shift and `xor` instructions. Do not attempt to use the matrix method! In case you need a refresher about how to work with hamming codes, consider watching 3blue1brown's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8jsijhllIA) on this topic. If you want to know how such error correction can be implemented in hardware, consider [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jloehRKas) video as well.

30. Given an andjacency matrix of an undirected graph with n nodes, check whether it is a connected graph and return 0 or 1 accordingly.\
function prototype
```c
uint8_t func (uint8_t* adjacency, uint8_t nodes)
```
The matrix is given as a linear 2D array of size n*n.\
Hints:
- A connected graph is a graph where there is a path from any node to any other node.
- Use DFS algorithm to traverse all nodes in the graph from some starting point. Push pointers to nodes onto the stack.
- Create a local array of size `nodes`, where each element is a boolean flag that shows whether or not the node was already visited.
- To create a local array, do not attempt to allocate it dynamically! Static arrays in `.data` are allowed, but discouraged. The best approach is to allocate it on a stack. In order to properly index it without affecting the DFS stack, consider using `rbx` stack frame variable.
- Dont forget about stack alignment.
